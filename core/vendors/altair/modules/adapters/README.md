Adapters
===

The Adapters module is comes with a handy \_HasAdaptersMixin that makes it easy for your module to utilize the adapter
pattern to solve the problem of normalizing input/output/etc.

Anytime you are working with any input/output where the source can change (databases or credit card
processors are a great examples) then you should use the \_HasAdaptersMixin
