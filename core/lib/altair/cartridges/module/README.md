# Module Cartridge

Dependencies: [ 'altair/cartridges/nexus/Nexus']

99% of Altair's power comes from the module system. Modules are more a way of thought, or convention, than an actual class
or type of object. In fact, a basic module need not mixin any other class in order to work. But, it's through the power of
mixins that the real power of the module system shows through.

Modules, in essence, are a complete feature set. For example, the email module should facilitate the sending of emails,
but also provide some nice configuration options for outgoing servers, templates, etc.

This cartridge requires the Nexus Cartridge for maximum functionality!
