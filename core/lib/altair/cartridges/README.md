Altair Cartridges
===

Cartridges are the lifeblood of Altair. In fact, if it weren't for the Module cartridge, your ass would never be able
to do much of anything useful. That's because most of the functionality in Altair is introduced by modules.

That being said, if you want to change the world, build a Module. If you want to help someone change the world by giving
 them some new, low level tool, use a Cartridge.
