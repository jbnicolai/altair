Altair's module layer is the starting point for any new idea or concept you want to turn into a product. It's like the
controller for a whole feature set. It delegates all work to other component (adapters, commanders, etc) so it is
considered good practice to keep your modules as thin as possible.

So, what does a module really do? It is what connects all the activities taking place elsewhere on the platform
with the systems you are producing. More often than not, it's simply hooking into events and kicking off whatever
business logic you need to fulfill the yours or the customers' needs.

Consider this; you want to start your coffee machine 10 minutes after you wake up (as apposed to a specific time). We
use a Fitbit to detect your wake up and for now we'll use a wifi power strip to turn on a coffee machine, one that you
setup the night before. Side note: we are having trouble finding an affordable connected coffee maker and we are
definitely not anywhere close to having one that can load itself.

coming soon..
