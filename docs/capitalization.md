### Capitalization
How does it work in altair? Really, it's very easy;

**Capitalzie your file if it contains something we are expected to instantiate.**

this allows me to draw the following conclusion;

**This file is capitalized so I will use the "new" operator to create a new instance before I use it**

This is very important to get straight because in Altair, we don't want to guess about how to utilize a component
you are building.

If you want to build something that is **NOT** instantiatable you should make a "facade." Learn more about wrapping classes
in simple function in our [terms](terms.md) overview.
